## Hi! Im JunoByte!
Welcome to my page! Take a look around! Who knows! You might have a barking good time!

### What is a JunoByte? 
Great question! Me! I am exactly 1 JunoByte! I am an artist, programmer, linux nerd, and (hopefully) your favorite husky! Here you will find my coding projects, dot files for my linux systems, and other projects. I am still learning, so I make no promises that my code is good. Its honestly more than likely the exact opposite. But feel free to play around with anything I post here!

In the future you can expect more porjects to be posted here, but I am rarely all that active here, and lately I have been focusing more on my art. But more code projects are right around the proverbial corner! Assuming I dont get distracted with chasing a bird or something.. but I digress!

### Where else can you find a JunoByte?
New Grounds! I post on New Grounds more than I post here as of late. Plus you can find my art there! Feel free to check it out! There are a ton of other great artists on there too! I even have a playlist of games that are for sure worth barking for! Check them out and share their work!

### A little serious now...
I hope you have a great time on my page, and enjoy my little corner of the internet! Feel free to message me if you have any questions!
