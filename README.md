## Hi! Im JunoByte!
Welcome to my page! Take a look around! Who knows! You might have a barking good time!

### What is a JunoByte? 
Great question! Me! I am exactly 1 JunoByte! I am an artist, programmer, linux nerd, and (hopefully) your favorite husky! Here you will find my coding projects, dot files for my linux systems, and other projects. I am still learning, so I make no promises that my code is good. Its honestly more than likely the exact opposite. But feel free to play around with anything I post here!

In the future you can expect more porjects to be posted here, but I am rarely all that active here, and lately I have been focusing more on my art. But more code projects are right around the proverbial corner! Assuming I dont get distracted with chasing a bird or something.. but I digress!

### Where else can you find a JunoByte?
 - New Grounds: https://junobyte.newgrounds.com/
I post on New Grounds more than I post here as of late. Plus you can find my art there! Feel free to check it out! There are a ton of other great artists on there too! I even have a playlist of games that are for sure worth barking for! Check them out and share their work!

- My personal website:  https://candy-canine-juno.neocities.org/
My personal geocities site made by me! It is out of date and requires some updating, which I plan to get around to at some point. Clearly that day is not today, because I have not removed this message. But you should still check it out! Theres some cool stuff there too! Granted, I am pretty biased on that front though. 

## A little serious now...
I hope you have a great time on my page, and enjoy my little corner of the internet! Feel free to message me if you have any questions!

As an aditional side note, consider this intro my official challenge to "professionalism" you can be professional and still preserve your authentic personality. Hopefully this stance helps someone else out too. Lastly, be polite, be respectful. Simple as. Have a good day!
